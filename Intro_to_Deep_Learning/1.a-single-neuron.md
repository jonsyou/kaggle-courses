# A Single Neuron

## What is Deep Learning?

**Deep learning** is an approach to machine learning characterized by deep stacks of computations. Through their power and scalability **neural networks** have become the defining model of deep learning.
Neural networks are composed of neurons, where each neuron individually performs only a simple computation. The power of a neural network comes instead from the complexity of the connections these neurons can form.

## The Linear Unit

As a diagram, a neuron (or unit) with one input looks like

*The Linear Unit:*   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74973306/104689395-ca1a1900-5745-11eb-8f3c-2ea47e0d49e3.png)

- The input is ```x```. Its connection to the neuron has a **weight** which is ```w```.  

- The ```b``` is a special kind of weight we call the **bias**.  

- The ```y``` is the value the neuron ultimately outputs. 

## Example - The Linear Unit as a Model

*Computing with the linear unit.*


And, checking against our formula, we have  ```calories=2.5Ã—5+90=102.5``` , just like we expect.

## Multiple Inputs

*A linear unit with three inputs.*

The formula for this neuron would be  ```y=w0x0+w1x1+w2x2+b``` . A linear unit with two inputs will fit a plane, and a unit with more inputs than that will fit a hyperplane.

## Linear Units in Keras

The easiest way to create a model in Keras is through ```keras.Sequential```, which creates a neural network as a stack of layers. We can create models like those above using a *dense* layer.

### Example

We could define a linear model accepting three input features (```'sugars'```, ```'fiber'```, and ```'protein'```) and producing a single output (```'calories'```) like so:

- three input features
- a single output

```python
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Create a network with 1 linear unit
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[3])
])
```
- With the first argument, ```units```, we define how many outputs we want. In this case we are just predicting ```'calories'```, so we'll use ```units=1```.
- With the second argument, input_shape, we tell Keras the dimensions of the inputs. Setting ```input_shape=[3]``` ensures the model will accept three features as input (```'sugars'```, ```'fiber'```, and ```'protein'```).

### Look at the weights

```python
w, b = model.weights

print("Weights\n{}\n\nBias\n{}".format(w, b))

[output]
'''
Weights
<tf.Variable 'dense/kernel:0' shape=(11, 1) dtype=float32, numpy=
array([[ 0.44852215],
       [ 0.09843111],
       [ 0.5993783 ],
       [-0.49273357],
       [ 0.00156194],
       [-0.39151135],
       [-0.6031064 ],
       [-0.4212773 ],
       [ 0.31457847],
       [ 0.46752948],
       [-0.17849845]], dtype=float32)>

Bias
<tf.Variable 'dense/bias:0' shape=(1,) dtype=float32, numpy=array([0.], dtype=float32)>
'''
```

### Optional: Plot the output of an untrained linear model

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(1, input_shape=[1]),
])

x = tf.linspace(-1.0, 1.0, 100)
y = model(x)

plt.figure(dpi=100)
plt.plot(x, y, 'k')
plt.xlim(-1, 1)
plt.ylim(-1, 1)
plt.xlabel("Input: x")
plt.ylabel("Target y")
w, b = model.weights # you could also use model.get_weights() here
plt.title("Weight: {:0.2f}\nBias: {:0.2f}".format(w[0][0], b[0]))
plt.show()
```
