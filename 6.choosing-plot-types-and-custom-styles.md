# Choosing Plot Types and Custom Styles

## What have you learned?

- **Trends** - A trend is defined as a pattern of change.
  - ```sns.lineplot``` - **Line charts** are best to show trends over a period of time, and multiple lines can be used to show trends in more than one group.
- **Relationship** - There are many different chart types that you can use to understand relationships between variables in your data.
  - ```sns.barplot``` - **Bar charts** are useful for comparing quantities corresponding to different groups.
  - ```sns.heatmap``` - **Heatmaps** can be used to find color-coded patterns in tables of numbers.
  - ```sns.scatterplot``` - **Scatter plots** show the relationship between two continuous variables; if color-coded, we can also show the relationship with a third categorical variable.
  - ```sns.regplot``` - Including a **regression line** in the scatter plot makes it easier to see any linear relationship between two variables.
  - ```sns.lmplot``` - This command is useful for drawing multiple regression lines, if the scatter plot contains multiple, color-coded groups.
  - ```sns.swarmplot``` - **Categorical scatter plots** show the relationship between a continuous variable and a categorical variable.
- **Distribution** - We visualize distributions to show the possible values that we can expect to see in a variable, along with how likely they are.
  - ```sns.distplot``` - **Histograms** show the distribution of a single numerical variable.
  - ```sns.kdeplot``` - **KDE plots** (or **2D KDE plots**) show an estimated, smooth distribution of a single numerical variable (or two numerical variables).
  - ```sns.jointplot``` - This command is useful for simultaneously displaying a 2D KDE plot with the corresponding KDE plots for each individual variable.
  
## Changing styles with seaborn

```python
# Path of the file to read
spotify_filepath = "../input/spotify.csv"

# Read the file into a variable spotify_data
spotify_data = pd.read_csv(spotify_filepath, index_col="Date", parse_dates=True)

# Line chart 
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.lineplot(data=spotify_data)
```

output

```python
# Change the style of the figure to the "dark" theme
sns.set_style("dark")

# Line chart 
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.lineplot(data=spotify_data)
```

- Seaborn has five different themes
  - ```"darkgrid"```
  - ```"whitegrid"```
  - ```"dark"```
  - ```"white"```
  - ```"ticks"```
